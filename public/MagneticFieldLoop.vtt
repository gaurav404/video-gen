00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.838
Let's solve a problem about the magnetic

00:00:05.938 --> 00:00:08.262
field created by a current-carrying circular loop.

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:11.738
We're given a circular loop with radius 3 centimeters.

00:00:11.838 --> 00:00:14.634
At a point 4 centimeters away from the center

00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:18.110
along the axis, the magnetic field is 54 micro-teslas.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.454
Our goal is to find the magnetic field at the center of the loop.

00:00:22.554 --> 00:00:24.840
To solve this problem, we need two key formulas

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.835
for the magnetic field of a circular current-carrying loop.

00:00:27.935 --> 00:00:30.197
For a point on the axis at distance x from

00:00:30.297 --> 00:00:33.347
the center, the magnetic field is given by this formula.

00:00:33.447 --> 00:00:36.638
And at the center of the loop, the formula simplifies to this.

00:00:36.738 --> 00:00:39.586
We know the magnetic field at the point on the axis, so

00:00:39.686 --> 00:00:42.803
we'll use the first formula to find the current in the loop.

00:00:42.903 --> 00:00:45.377
Then we'll use that current in the second formula

00:00:45.477 --> 00:00:47.531
to find the magnetic field at the center.

00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:51.352
Let's first look at where the student solution went wrong.

00:00:51.452 --> 00:00:53.763
The student used the correct formula for the

00:00:53.863 --> 00:00:55.845
magnetic field at a point on the axis.

00:00:55.945 --> 00:00:59.465
However, the student made a critical error. They wrote 24

00:00:59.565 --> 00:01:03.212
micro-tesla instead of the correct value of 54 micro-tesla.

00:01:03.312 --> 00:01:06.360
This error led to calculating an incorrect current, and

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.507
consequently an incorrect magnetic field at the center.

00:01:09.607 --> 00:01:11.623
Let's now solve the problem correctly.

00:01:11.723 --> 00:01:14.314
Let's solve the problem correctly, step by step.

00:01:14.414 --> 00:01:16.116
First, we'll list the known values.

00:01:16.414 --> 00:01:19.347
Using the formula for the magnetic field at a point on

00:01:19.447 --> 00:01:21.930
the axis, we can find the current in the loop.

00:01:22.014 --> 00:01:23.429
Substituting our known values.

00:01:24.014 --> 00:01:26.369
Simplifying and solving for I times mu naught.

00:01:26.414 --> 00:01:30.676
Multiply both sides by 250 times 10 to the negative 6.

00:01:30.747 --> 00:01:33.001
Divide both sides by 9 times 10 to the

00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:35.480
negative 4 to isolate mu naught times I.

00:01:35.547 --> 00:01:37.294
Now we can use the formula for the

00:01:37.394 --> 00:01:39.522
magnetic field at the center of the loop.

00:01:39.614 --> 00:01:44.660
So the magnetic field at the center of the loop is 250 micro-teslas.

00:01:44.747 --> 00:01:48.670
The correct answer is option A, 250 micro-teslas.

00:01:49.747 --> 00:01:52.569
Let's visualize how the magnetic field changes with

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:54.689
distance from the center of the loop.

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:57.419
On this graph, the x-axis represents the distance

00:01:57.519 --> 00:01:59.625
from the center along the axis, and the

00:01:59.725 --> 00:02:02.850
y-axis shows the magnetic field strength in micro-teslas.

00:02:02.947 --> 00:02:05.405
The magnetic field is strongest at the

00:02:05.505 --> 00:02:08.098
center of the loop, at 250 micro-teslas.

00:02:08.147 --> 00:02:11.223
As we move away from the center along the axis,

00:02:11.323 --> 00:02:15.481
the field strength decreases. At 4 centimeters from the center,

00:02:15.581 --> 00:02:18.522
it's 54 micro-teslas as given in the problem.

00:02:18.614 --> 00:02:21.885
This graph clearly shows that the magnetic field at the center of

00:02:21.985 --> 00:02:25.567
a current-carrying loop is much stronger than at points along its axis.

00:02:26.614 --> 00:02:28.786
Let's summarize what we've learned from this problem.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.020
First, the student made an error by using 24 micro-teslas instead of

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.322
the correct value of 54 micro-teslas, leading to an incorrect answer.

00:02:37.414 --> 00:02:41.828
By correctly substituting the given value of 54 micro-teslas, we found

00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:45.568
that the magnetic field at the center is 250 micro-teslas.

00:02:45.614 --> 00:02:48.351
This problem demonstrates that the magnetic field is

00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:51.135
strongest at the center of a current-carrying loop,

00:02:51.235 --> 00:02:53.481
and decreases with distance along the axis.

00:02:53.547 --> 00:02:57.470
The correct answer is option A, 250 micro-teslas.

00:02:57.547 --> 00:03:01.797
Remember to always double-check your values when substituting into formulas,

00:03:01.897 --> 00:03:05.232
as small errors can lead to significantly different results.
